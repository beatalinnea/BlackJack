# A3
- I (Beata Eriksson, be222gr) have worked alone in this assignment.

## Instructions
- Run the game with ```./gradlew run -q --console=plain```
- You will be presented with the menu and options
- When typing 'p' to play the console will dynamically view when the dealer or the player gets a card
- Then the menu and options and game status will be present again for you to make a move

## Notes
- About amount of commits - I did them per task and since I made each task in a sitting I did not feel the need to commit 20 times, it was excessive and would have made no sense. When I review my commits each commit achieved a specific task so I hope this is enough to follow the natural growth of the application even though the requirements states to have made at least 20 commits..
